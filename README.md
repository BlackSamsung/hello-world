# hello-world
Hello_world is the first repository created by me and its the starting of the new project.
I'm College passed out student but I still have backlogs but I've intrest in coding. I know about python programming language and and I wanna take my coding skill to next level. I want to become data scientist, I've read somewhere that "Data Scientist is someone who is better at statistic than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician." This phrase inspired me so much and force me to work hard to become data scientist.
